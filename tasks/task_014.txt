# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Multi-Cell Orchestration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9, 11, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the orchestration system for managing multiple NeuroSpark cells for horizontal scaling.
# Details:
1. Design cell architecture:
   - Cell definition and boundaries
   - Inter-cell communication
   - Resource allocation
2. Implement cell management:
   - Cell creation and deletion
   - Cell health monitoring
   - Load balancing between cells
3. Create data partitioning strategies
4. Implement cross-cell queries
5. Add cell-specific configuration
6. Create cell failover mechanisms
7. Implement cell scaling policies

# Test Strategy:
1. Test cell creation and management
2. Validate inter-cell communication
3. Test load balancing effectiveness
4. Verify data partitioning
5. Test cross-cell queries
6. Validate failover mechanisms
7. Test scaling under load

# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Docker Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with Docker configuration for containerization and local development environment via docker-compose.
# Details:
1. Create a new Git repository for NeuroSpark Core
2. Set up a basic project structure with directories for each service/agent
3. Create a Dockerfile for the base image with common dependencies
4. Create service-specific Dockerfiles that extend the base image
5. Set up docker-compose.yml for local development with services for:
   - FastAPI/gRPC API service
   - Postgres 16 database
   - Qdrant vector database
   - ElasticLite for BM25 search
   - MinIO for blob storage
   - Redis for message bus
6. Configure environment variables and .env file structure
7. Create a README with setup instructions
8. Implement basic health check endpoints for each service

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all containers build successfully
2. Ensure containers can communicate with each other
3. Validate environment variable injection
4. Test health check endpoints
5. Verify local development workflow with hot-reloading

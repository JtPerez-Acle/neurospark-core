# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Professor Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Professor Agent that drafts lessons and answers with citations using vector data from the knowledge base.
# Details:
1. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system:
   - Hybrid search combining Qdrant (ANN) and ElasticLite (BM25)
   - Relevance scoring and reranking
2. Create lesson generation using OpenAI gpt-4o:
   - Prompt engineering for factual responses
   - Citation generation from source documents
   - Structured lesson format
3. Implement answer generation for specific questions
4. Create citation linking to original sources
5. Implement fallback to local Llama-3-GGUF model
6. Add context window management for large lessons
7. Create draft versioning system
8. Implement knowledge graph enrichment

# Test Strategy:
1. Test retrieval accuracy with known queries
2. Validate citation accuracy against source documents
3. Test lesson structure and readability
4. Benchmark generation performance
5. Test fallback to local models
6. Validate context window management
7. Test with various knowledge domains

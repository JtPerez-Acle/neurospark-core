# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Auditor Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Auditor Agent that spot-checks global metrics for relevance, cost, and latency with a low false-negative rate.
# Details:
1. Implement metric collection system:
   - Relevance scoring for content
   - Cost tracking per operation
   - Latency measurement
   - Error rate monitoring
2. Create sampling strategies for spot-checks:
   - Random sampling
   - Stratified sampling
   - Targeted sampling for high-risk areas
3. Implement validation workflows:
   - Automated checks
   - Manual review triggers
4. Create anomaly detection:
   - Statistical outlier detection
   - Trend analysis
5. Implement reporting and alerting
6. Create continuous improvement recommendations
7. Add false-negative tracking and optimization

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with known issues to verify detection
2. Validate sampling strategies for coverage
3. Test anomaly detection with simulated anomalies
4. Measure false-negative rate (target â‰¤2%)
5. Test reporting and alerting mechanisms
6. Validate recommendation quality
7. Benchmark auditing performance impact

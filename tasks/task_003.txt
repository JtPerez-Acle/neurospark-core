# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Agent Framework and Communication System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational Agent framework and implement the Redis Streams-based message bus for inter-agent communication.
# Details:
1. Design base Agent class with common functionality:
   - Configuration loading
   - Logging and telemetry
   - Health reporting
   - Rate limiting
   - Error handling
2. Implement Redis Streams producer/consumer patterns:
   - Message serialization/deserialization
   - Consumer groups for load balancing
   - Dead letter queues for failed messages
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
3. Create message schemas for inter-agent communication
4. Implement service discovery mechanism
5. Design migration path to NATS as specified in PRD
6. Create Agent lifecycle management (start, stop, pause)
7. Implement graceful shutdown handling

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for base Agent functionality
2. Integration tests for message passing between Agents
3. Stress tests for message bus under load
4. Test failure recovery scenarios
5. Validate message schemas
6. Test service discovery mechanism

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Base Agent Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational Agent class encapsulating configuration loading, logging, telemetry, health reporting, rate limiting, and error handling.
### Details:
Establish a reusable base class that provides core agent functionality, ensuring extensibility for future agent types.

## 2. Develop Redis Streams Message Bus [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement the Redis Streams-based message bus, including producer/consumer patterns, message serialization/deserialization, consumer groups, dead letter queues, and retry logic.
### Details:
Enable robust inter-agent communication with scalable message handling and fault tolerance using Redis Streams.

## 3. Define and Enforce Message Schemas [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Create and validate message schemas for all inter-agent communication to ensure consistency and interoperability.
### Details:
Use schema validation tools to enforce message structure and support versioning for future extensibility.

## 4. Implement Service Discovery Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop a service discovery system to enable agents to locate and communicate with each other dynamically.
### Details:
Integrate with existing infrastructure or implement a lightweight registry to track active agents and their endpoints.

## 5. Build Agent Lifecycle and Graceful Shutdown Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Implement lifecycle management for agents, including start, stop, pause, and graceful shutdown handling.
### Details:
Ensure agents can be managed programmatically and handle shutdowns without data loss or message corruption.

10. Add support for custom source plugins

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each API client
2. Mock tests for API responses
3. Integration tests with actual APIs (with rate limiting)
4. Test fallback mechanisms
5. Validate metadata extraction
6. Test deduplication logic
7. Verify scheduling functionality

# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Curator Agent
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the Curator Agent responsible for discovering documents from trusted sources like OpenAlex, NewsAPI, and SerpAPI.
# Details:
1. Implement API clients for data sources:
   - OpenAlex client for academic papers
   - NewsAPI client for news articles
   - SerpAPI client for web search results
2. Create document discovery strategies for each source
3. Implement scheduling logic for periodic discovery
4. Design document metadata extraction
5. Create source credibility scoring system
6. Implement rate limiting and quota management
7. Add fallback mechanisms for API outages
8. Create document deduplication logic
9. Implement document priority queue based on relevance
10. Add support for custom source plugins

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each API client
2. Mock tests for API responses
3. Integration tests with actual APIs (with rate limiting)
4. Test fallback mechanisms
5. Validate metadata extraction
6. Test deduplication logic
7. Verify scheduling functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop and Test API Clients for Data Sources [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create robust API clients for OpenAlex, NewsAPI, and SerpAPI, ensuring support for authentication, parameterization, and response validation.
### Details:
Begin by writing tests that validate API connectivity, authentication, response structure, and error handling for each data source. Implement the clients to pass these tests, following best practices for API client development and test automation.

## 2. Implement and Test Document Discovery Strategies [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Design and validate strategies for discovering relevant documents from each source, including query formulation and filtering.
### Details:
Write tests to ensure that discovery strategies return relevant, non-duplicate documents and handle edge cases such as empty results or API-specific quirks. Implement strategies to pass these tests.

## 3. Design and Test Metadata Extraction and Credibility Scoring [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Extract and normalize metadata from discovered documents and implement a system to score source credibility.
### Details:
Write tests to verify correct extraction and normalization of metadata fields (e.g., title, author, date, source) and to validate the credibility scoring logic against known trusted and untrusted sources.

## 4. Implement and Test Scheduling, Rate Limiting, and Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Develop logic for periodic document discovery, enforce API rate limits, and add fallback mechanisms for handling API outages.
### Details:
Write tests to ensure scheduled tasks trigger as expected, rate limits are respected, and fallback mechanisms activate during API failures.

## 5. Develop and Test Gradio-Based Monitoring Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Create a Gradio interface to visualize the Curator Agent's real-time activity, including discovered documents, source status, and system metrics.
### Details:
Write tests to verify that the interface displays accurate, up-to-date information and handles user interactions correctly.

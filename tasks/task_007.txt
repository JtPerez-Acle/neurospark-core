# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Reviewer Agent
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the Reviewer Agent that validates draft citations via RAG similarity & factuality checks using rougeL and bertscoreF1 metrics.
# Details:
1. Implement citation validation system:
   - Extract claims and citations from drafts
   - Retrieve original sources for each citation
   - Compare claims against sources
2. Create metric calculation:
   - Implement rougeL scoring
   - Implement bertscoreF1 calculation
   - Create combined factuality score
3. Implement hallucination detection:
   - Identify unsupported claims
   - Flag potential fabrications
4. Create feedback loop to Professor for corrections
5. Implement approval/rejection workflow
6. Create detailed validation reports
7. Add confidence scoring for validations

# Test Strategy:
1. Test with known hallucinations to verify detection
2. Validate metric calculations against reference implementations
3. Test with various citation styles and formats
4. Measure false positive and false negative rates
5. Test feedback loop with Professor
6. Validate that â‰¥95% of seeded hallucinations are caught
7. Benchmark validation performance
